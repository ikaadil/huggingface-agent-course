An agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.

Think of the Agent as having two main parts:
  - The Brain (AI Model)
  - The Body (Capabilities and Tools)

Agent must do
  - **Understand natural language**: Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.
  - **Reason and plan**: Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.
  - **Interact with its environment**: Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.
